# Random-password-generator
This simple random password generator was created with only one thing in mind, security. Nowadays most of the people create their own password with sentimental value or other parameters that are easily crackable by a posible attacker. That is why, I created a two-piece algorithm that is able to create pseudo-random passwords in different blocks and then joins those blocks into one highly secure password.
# How it Works
The way this works is quite simple. You can choose how many passwords would you like to create at the same time. This algorithm, divides the password into three sections separated with a score (“-“). The length of these sections can be determined by the user. The characters used include both upper and lower case letters, and numbers.
